# Phoenix
Phoenix is a script that automates some infrastructure tests with known CLI tools.  
I'm doing this script just to make my life easier. If it helps you, I'm glad to know!
  
Future features:  
-> Speed (choosing between fast, medium and low tests): increasing time to sleep between tests and change ffuf rate based on your option  
-> Auto-answers with expect tool  
-> Other ports and tests
