# Phoenix
Phoenix is a script that automates some infrastructure tests with known CLI tools.  
I'm doing this script just to make my life easier. If it helps you, I'm glad to know!
  
Problems to fix:  
-> SSH tests  
-> Why tests is happening in port 80 instead of port 443  

Future features:  
-> Speed (choosing between fast, medium and low tests): increasing time to sleep between tests and change ffuf rate based on your option  
-> Auto-answers with expect tool  
-> Other ports and tests
